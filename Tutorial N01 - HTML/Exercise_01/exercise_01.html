            <h1>RVHS - H2 Computing</h1>
            <h2>Welcome</h2>
            <p>Welcome to River Valley High School. We offer H2 Computing as an A-Level subject as part of our Junior College Curriculum.</p>
            <h2>About H2 Computing</h2>
            <p>We use Python as our main language in this subject.</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.python.org">Here is a link to the offical Python Website.</a></p>
            <p>Here are three reasons H2 Computing is cool:</p>
            <p>     1. It's useful and practical.</p>
            <p>     2. There are a lot of interesting questions.</p>
            <p>     3. We can build authentic real-life applications.</p>
            <h2>Coursemology</h2>
            <p>Our main learning platform is Coursemology, a gamified platform which allows us to access
               learning notes and attempt tutorial questions.</p>
